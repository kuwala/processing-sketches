# Collection of my Processing Sketchs
Most of these are in Java or p5js formats

## History of the sketch collection
I started out using processing 2 then processing 3 came out
and I used that for a while. What I really wanted was a good
web version of processing processing.js was not too interesting for me.
When p5.js cameout I used that a bunch on plunker.

Now I Primerly use p5.js and am getting back into processing 3 for some
desktop uses.
